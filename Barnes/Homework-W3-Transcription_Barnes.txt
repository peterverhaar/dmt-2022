Dear Woolf,


        It was very nice of you to put it as you did. But I don’t really know if you want to publish an improved version of that pamphlet. The chief question to be answered is whether the public could be reached better by the Hogarth Press or by the I.L.P? I suppose your heart answers ‘how the hell can I tell’? 


Subsidiary questions are 1. What price would you sell at? 2. Who would stand the cost and profit or loss – me or you? 3. Would copies be sent out for review? 4. Right this pamphlet interfere with the sale of the cheat <illegible> of Kenya? 


Could you answer some of these questions?  And if Keynes’ pamphlet has stopped selling, may I have a copy?


I am very glad you told me the pamphlet needs rewriting. For weeks on end I am incapable of my best. And my best is good enough for publication in so restricted a field that I shall have to be very careful not to let the success of ‘Kenya’ tempt me to put out worthless shitt. In this care I shall wait a week or two and try to improve the pamphlet.


I do wish people would realise that in many ways I am rather stupid. I can arrange, clarify and in interpret data, can analyze and estimate—even foresee so far as to plan a coordinate *illegible*. But the facts must be in full sight. I cannot ‘sense’ things. So I can contribute nothing original except what arises from the data themselves when I set them in true relation. 


I hope Mrs. Woolf is better, long ago.  Yours Norman Leys
