Mr. Norman Leys,
Brailsford, Nr. Derby,
England.

My dear Mr. Leys:

I am afraid your publisher is spoofing you. No copy of "Kenya" has been received by The Crisis magazine. However I have borrowed a copy from a friend and I am going to review it in a near number. I have nearly finished reading it and am greatly impressed by its importance and the hard work which you have done to gather the material. I do not know that you can hope for a very large circulation of the book in the United States, English books are so very costly. Nevertheless I will give it such publicity as I can and certainly some sales ought to result.

Very sincerely yours.
