Mr. Norman Leys,
Brailsford, Nr. Derby,
England.

My dear Mr. Leys:

I am afraid your publisher is
spoofing you. No copy of "Kenya" has
been received by The Crisis magazine.
However I have borrowed a copy from a
friend and I am going to review it in
a near number. I have nearly finished
reading it and am greatly impressed
by its importance and the hard work
which you have done to gather the
material. I do not know that you can
hope for a very large circulation of
the book in the United States, English
books are so very costly. Nevertheless
I wil give it such publicity as I can
and certainly some sales ought to result.

very sincerely yours,
W.E.B. Du Bois
