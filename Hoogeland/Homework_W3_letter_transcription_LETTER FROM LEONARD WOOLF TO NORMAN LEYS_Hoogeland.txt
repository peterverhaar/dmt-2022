Dr. Leys,
Brailsford. Nr. Derby.

Dear Leys:

I have had estimates from the printer with regard to the cheap edition and I enclose a statement working out the cost of a first printing of alternatively 1,000 and 2,000 copies, binding in stiff paper cover, and allow-ing Fifty Pounds for advertising. The statement also estimates a copy of the printer's letter which gives the price for binding in limp cloth, plain boards, and plain cloth alternatively, so that you can see the additional cost in each of these cases. My own opinion is that if it is to be a 4s, 6d. book it must be bound in stiff pa-per. I can send you a dummy copy in stiff paper if you like to see it. What do you feel about the figures, and is there any question connected with them which you would like me to give my opinion on?

Yours,
