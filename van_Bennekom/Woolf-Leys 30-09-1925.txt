Dear Leys,
			I enclose a cheque for Â£20. I will look into the a/c when
I go back to town on Friday for good anf see whether we ought not to
pay you more.
		We must certainly discuss the cheap edition when you are in town.
It would be most important to get organizations to take it. I think
it is almost ceeraub tat some of the copies sold during the last weeks
went to America, as Simpkins, the wgolesalers, took two lots
of 12 with a very short interval--which looks, considering what sales 
had been, as if they had an order of 6 or 12 for export quite suddenly.

					Yours
