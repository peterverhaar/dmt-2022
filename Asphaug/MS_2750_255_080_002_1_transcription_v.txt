Andrews writes to say that 
some of his Indian friends want to have a 
translation of parts of ‘Kenya’ into 
Hindi!  I have told him to com-
municate any definite proposal to 
you.
Please send one copy of ‘Kenya’ 
to James Maxton Esq.  MP., Beechwood, 
Barrhead, near Glasgow. I conceived 
a great admiration for him at Eaton 
Lodge. His ignorance about a variety 
of things is remediable and he
 has all 
the natural qualities 
needed for 
a leader 
of the 
whole 
movement.

     Yours
