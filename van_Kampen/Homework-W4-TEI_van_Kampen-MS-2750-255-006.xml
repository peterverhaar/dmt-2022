                        Dear Leys,
                    </salute>
                </opener>
                <p>
                    I do not wish to be guilty of "unprofessional conduct". <lb/>
                    But on the other hand I do not want you to sign a bad agreement. <lb/>
                    We are very curious publishers ourselves. It began purely as <lb/>
                    a hobby of printing and has grown of its own motion until now <lb/>
                    my wife and I cannot deal with it ourselves. Consequently we  <lb/>
                    have a young woman manager and we have just taken in a young man <lb/>
                    as a partner. Whether we can ensure the publicity that an  <lb/>
                    old established firm gets I cannot say--probably we do not get <lb/>
                    the same results as they do with travelling bookshops particul-<lb/>
                    arly in the provinces. On the other hand I have no respect at <lb/>
                    all for their out and dried methods.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As regards Unwin I think possibly &#x20AC;300 might be not an <lb/>
                    unfair price if that makes very good provision for advertizing. <lb/>
                    But he must tell you what amount is included in it for advertiz-<lb/>
                    ing. He must tell you what his 15&#37; is. He must account to <lb/>
                    you at 12 copies for 12. In fact he ought to give you the <lb/>
                    fullest possible information of the items which are to make up <lb/>
                    the &#x20AC;300 or &#xA3;350, if he stick to that, and of what his commission is.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have published ourselves novels and poetry and one "serv-<lb/>
                    ious" work Stephen Reynolds's Letters which was published at <lb/>
                    16/-. We are also branching out and becoming the publishers <lb/>
                    to The Psycho-Analytical Press. Frankly if Unwin will give you <lb/>
                    a fair and reasonable agreement, I think you ought to stick to <lb/> 
                    him as it has gone so far and is already rather late if you <lb/>
                    are to get it out in the autumn. But if he wont, then you <lb/>
                    ought to try some other publisher, and, in my opinion, at any  <lb/>
                    rate let us see exactly what it can be produced for for you.
