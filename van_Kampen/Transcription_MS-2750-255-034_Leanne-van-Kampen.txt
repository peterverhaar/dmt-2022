Dear Woolf,

There were half a dozen
or more [illegible] and passages as 
to which I expected you to after
criticism of [illegible] some inexpediency
or some [illegible] from good taste. I
often wished I could forsee just
which sentences would show their
faults on the printed page. But I
never expected you to object to my
D.P.H. I am afraid I rather badly
want to proclaim it. I shall explain
why when we do meet, as some
day we surely must.
That first chapter reads - in print
- hastily and scrappily as if I
wanted to start the reader off at top
speed. Also there are one or two sentences
too emotional. I hope to think better
of chap [illegible].
Yours [illegible]
