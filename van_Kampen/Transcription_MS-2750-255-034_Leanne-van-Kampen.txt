Dear Woolf,

There [illegible] half a dozen
or more [illegible] and passages as 
[illegible] which I expecged [illegible] after
criticism of [illegible] some inexpediency
or some [illegible] from good taste. I
often wished I could forsee just
which sentences would show their
faults on the printed page
