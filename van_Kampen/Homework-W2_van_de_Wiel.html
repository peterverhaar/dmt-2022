    <p>Hi, I'm Leanne van Kampen. I'm 22 years old, live in Utrecht and just graduated from the BA <a href= https://www.uu.nl/bachelors/en/english-language-and-culture>English Language and Culture</a> at Utrecht University.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>These are the languages I'm profient at:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Dutch (native speaker)</li>
        <li>English (C2)</li>
    </ul>

    </p>
    <p>Other language skills I have include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Spanish (reading and listening: B1, speaking and writing: A2)</li>
        <li>French (reading and listening: C1, speaking and writing: B1)</li>
        <li>German (reading and listening: B1, speaking and writing: A1)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I also know some Latin, not as much ancient Greek, and have learned a bit of Old English at some point.</p>
    <p>The general idea is: if you give me a text, I'm way more likely to know what it says than when you're talking to me. I just really like languages, but more so the historical side (language history, etymology, etc.) than actually putting in the effort to master a language.</p>
