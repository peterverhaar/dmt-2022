Dear Leys,

I do not wish to be guilty of "unprofessional conduct".
But on the other hand I do not want you to sign a bad agreement.
We are very curious publishers ourselves. It began purely as
a hobby of printing and has grown of its own motion until now
my wife and I cannot deal with it ourselves. Consequently we 
have a young woman manager and we have just taken in a young man
as a partner. Whether we can ensure the publicity that an 
old established firm gets I cannot say--probably we do not get
the same results as they do with travelling bookshops particul-
arly in the provinces. On the other hand I have no respect at
all for their out and dried methods.

As regards Unwin I think possibly €300 might be not an
unfair price if that makes very good provision for advertizing.
But he must tell you what amount is included in it for advertiz-
ing. He must tell you what his 15% is. He must account to 
you at 12 copies for 12. In fact he ought to give you the 
fullest possible information of the items which are to make up
the €300 or £350, if he stick to that, and of what his commission is.

We have published ourselves novels and poetry and one "serv-
ious" work Stephen Reynolds's Letters which was published at 
16/-. We are also branching out and becoming the publishers
to The Psycho-Analytical Press. Frankly if Unwin will give you
a fair and reasonable agreement, I think you ought to stick to 
him as it has gone so far and is already rather late if you
are to get it out in the autumn. But if he wont, then you
ought to try some other publisher, and, in my opinion, at any 
rate let us see exactly what it can be produced for for you.

Yours,
Leonard Woolf
