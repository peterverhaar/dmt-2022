LETTER FROM LEONARD WOOLF TO FREDERICK HARRIS

Dear Mr Harris,

		Dr Norman Leys has forwarded to me your letter regarding his book KENYA. Do you think that you would consider taking a certain number of copies in sheets which you could issue in the U.S.A. as your own edition? This would materially limit your expense and risk. The possibility which I have in mind is you’re taking from us say 200 copies in sheets at cost price, which would come to about £15 per hundred excluding carriage to the U.S.A. If you found that you wanted more later and we still had them available, we would let you have a further supply at £15 per 100 copies. 

	Would you let me know what you think of this? If it is impossible, I should be glad to send you a small number of bound copies on sale; but in that case, would you let me know the kind of number what she had in mind. As you are aware, the cost of sending a large bound book like KENYA in any numbers is considerable. 

		Yours truly
