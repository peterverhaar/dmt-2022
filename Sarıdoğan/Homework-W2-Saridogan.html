    <h1>Hi there!</h1>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="me!.jpg" height="400" width="400"></p>

<p>I'm Eda! I'm 22 and I live in Amsterdam. I studied <a href="https://www.uva.nl/en/programmes/bachelors/english-language-and-culture/english-language-and-culture.html"> English Language and Culture</a> at the <i>University of Amsterdam</i> for my BA with a focus on English literature, and then went on to do an MA in <a href="https://www.eur.nl/en/master/cultural-economics-and-entrepreneurship"> Cultural Economics</a> at <i>Erasmus University Rotterdam</i>.</p>
<p>I ultimately decided to follow this MA in Book and Digital Media Studies to pursue a career in publishing or a related field. My interest in publishing (beyond my love for literature) was sparked by my work in magazines both digital-born and print; I even ended up writing my MA thesis in cultural economics on digital transformation in independent magazine publishing. Currently I have a magazine with fellow friends called <a href="https://www.loosedogmagazine.com/"> <b>Loose Dog Magazine</b></a> where in addition to many creative and administrative responsibilities I am also tasked with creating and maintaining the website.</p>
<p>Languages I speak in order of fluency:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>English</li>
    <li>Turkish</li>
    <li>Spanish</li>
</ul>
 <table>
     <tr>
         <th>Prior Knowledge</th>
         <td>I don't have much experience in anything related to coding beyond clicking "inspect element" and playing around with whatever I see; I tried to learn Python once for a research project in sociolinguistics, but it ended up being too complicated and too advanced to be actually useful.</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
         <th>Expectations</th>
         <td>I expect to learn valuable coding skills in this course that I can apply in a real world context; I think even knowing and understanding the basics of languages like Python is very important in today's world.</td>
