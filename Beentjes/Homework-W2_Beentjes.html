<h1>Introducing myself :)</h1>
    <p>Hi everyone! Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Manon Beentjes (22 y/o) and I live in Beverwijk which is around 40 minutes by train from Leiden. I live with my partner and two cats (Otis and Pluis), and since I moved out of my parental home I often miss my dog who still lives with my parents. Even though I live with two cats, I'm actually a dog person, but please do not tell my cats that. My favorite tings are rainy weather, cozy sweaters, tea, reading, and Italian food (especially pasta).</p>
    <p>Prior to this master programme, I studied English Language and Culture at the <a href=https://www.uva.nl/en>University of Amsterdam</a>. Next to studying, I've also kept myself busy with building a business in women's clothing and jewelry called <a href=https://lookiess.nl/>Lookiess</a>, and building a bookish Instagram blog called <a href=https://www.instagram.com/bookswithonno>bookswithonno</a> on which I review books.</p>
    <img src="me.jpg" height="200" width="150">
    <p>Some of my favorite books are:
    <ul>
        <li>The Little Prince by Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry</li>
        <li>Anxious People by Fredrik Backman</li>
        <li>Heartstopper by Alice Oseman</li>
    </ul></p>
