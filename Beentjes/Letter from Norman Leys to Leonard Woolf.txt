Dear <persName> Woolf </persName> , I am most grateful for <lb></lb> [unintelligible] so frank and so dear.
I see no sense in having a <lb></lb> cheap edition at all [unintelligible] I could <lb></lb> hope for a <em> big </em> sale. 
(I have hurt my <lb></lb> finger I can scracely write.)
I have <lb></lb> failed to find any of the large "organ- <lb></lb> izations and societies" [unintelligible] mention <lb></lb> - failed to find any who are ready to do anything [unintelligible] the matter.
Also I <lb></lb> suspect that considerable expendit- <lb></lb> ure on advertising is more likely to <lb></lb> turn a small loss into a large one <lb></lb> than the reverse.
So it seems to me I ought to inves- <lb></lb> tigate the advisability of getting <lb></lb> the cheap ed. published by a firm <lb></lb> [unintelligible] a large selling organisation, <lb></lb> though I should greatly regret such <lb></lb> a change.
If I did that you would <lb></lb> get the royalty to which morally <lb></lb> and for all I know legally as well <lb></lb> you are entitled.
I certainly <em> won't </em> approach [unintelligible] <lb></lb> {unintelligible].
But I should be grateful for the names of the <lb></lb> three <lb></lb> [unintelligible] who in your judgement would <lb></lb> serve my purpose best.
They <lb></lb> ought to have  [unintelligible] or agents <lb></lb> in India, Capetown and the U.S.A. <lb></lb>
What I should like best <lb></lb> would be to find a publisher <lb></lb> (preferably yourself) who in <lb></lb> return for Â£50 [unintelligible] would <lb></lb> publish 3000 or 4000 copies <lb></lb> at 4/6 and sell them as best <lb></lb> he could. <lb></lb>
Yours Sincerely <lb></lb> <persName> Norman Leys </persName> <lb></lb> p.s. <lb> </lb> 
I have just referred to our <lb></lb> agreement wherein it is clear <lb></lb>
<ol>
<li> 1. That you could insist on <lb></lb> publishing the cheap edition <lb></lb> yourself. </li>
<li> 2. That your allowing me to <lb></lb> get it published elsewhere <lb></lb> [unintelligible] the surrender of <lb></lb> a substantial probable profit. </li>
<li> 3. That if I do publish <lb></lb> elsewhere you are clearly <lb></lb> entitles to a royalty </li>
</ol>
