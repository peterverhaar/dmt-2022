Dear Leys,

1. I have ordered the book to be bound in PVA452, the red chosen by you.

2. I will try to get you a little pamphlet on proof correcting when I go to town on Monday.

3. Will you return the chapters which you are revising as soon as possible?

4. If I am to send the Ms to Major Church the Labour M.P. I could certainly write him a letter as Sec of the Advisory Comm advising him to read the book. You will let me know when and to whom I am to send the MS.?

5. I haven't had a letter of yours from your brother.

Yours

Dear Woolf,

I expect by this time that the [illegible] letter will have reached you.

I [illegible] in the undecided prints, to vote for a book A. of 15/- B. of 1050 copies C. with an index. That is, if I have to decide.

The departure of the membership committee was announced in yesterday's papers. But as they go to Northern Rhodesia [illegible] I suggest that the MSS should be sent 
to Zambia, British Nyasaland, with, as you kindly agree, a letter from the Sec. of the advisory committee. (Major Church M.P. is our man. Would you ask him to
have the other two read the MSS?)

I shall let you have the missing chaps. by Monday morning.

Yours Norman Leys
