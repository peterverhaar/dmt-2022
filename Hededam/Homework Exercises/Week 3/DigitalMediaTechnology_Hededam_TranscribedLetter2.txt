Gentlemen:
	
	Your letter of October 5 has come to hand.I
was just about to write you. Our Board of Publication
has finally met and feels that at the present time, 
they cannot undertake any investment with regard to
Norman Leys KENYA. I think that all are agreed as
to its value for certain groups in this country.
The difficulty facing us this fall is the heavy
capital investment due to the large demand of this
institution. Dr. Ley's book was one of a large
number of items which we felt would have to be set
aside at the present time.

	I regret this necessity exceedingly because
I have been most deeply impressed by the book.

		Yours very sincerely,
			*illegible*
