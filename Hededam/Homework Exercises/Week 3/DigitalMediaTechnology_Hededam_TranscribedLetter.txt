Dear Leys:
	I have received a letter from a man, enclosing a cheque for
Â£20.,  "as a gift for the specific purpose of inserting advertise-
ments of Kenya in (a) The Times, (b) The Spectator, (c) The Morn-
ing Post." He gives this money on the strict understanding
that I shall keep the matter confidential and not divulge his
name to anyone. I presume that I am, therefore, debarred from
disclosing his name to you. He says that his reasons for doing 
this are "it appears to me that in the interest of Colonial ad-
ministration it is most desirable that a book of such outstanding
ability and importance should have an increased cirlulation".
I do not like to accept this without your consent, though I cer-
tainly think that it ought to be accepted. If it is, the adver-
tising certainly ought not to be done until after Christmas.
Would you let me know what you think about it?
			Yours  
			
			JSW 15/12
