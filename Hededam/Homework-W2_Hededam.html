    <i>Hi! Welcome to my profile, I'm happy you're here.</i>
    <h2>A few things about me:</h2>
    <p>As mentioned, my name is Christine. I'm 23 years old and come from Denmark. Born and raised in the suburbs of Copenhagen, I moved to the US when I was 16 and lived there for a year as an exchange student. That year lit a spark of curiosity towards living abroad and strongly influenced my decision to attend international school in Denmark and later pursue my university degree in the Netherlands. Now, I'm happy to call The Hague my home — and although the plan was to return to Denmark after my Bachelor's Degree, I've decided to settle here in the Netherlands.</p>
    <h3>Academics</h3>
    I did my BA in <a href="https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/education/study-programmes/bachelor/international-studies">International Studies at Leiden Univeristy</a>. I specialized in North America with a French language track (but where those language skills went, I have no idea). During my BA, I mostly spent my time at The Hague Campus. However, I did a customized minor and an extracurricular internship in Leiden last year.
    <h4>Languages</h4>
    <p>Coding Languages:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The very basics of <b>Python</b>;</li>
        <li>and now I'm learning <b>HTML</b>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Other Languages:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Danish</b></li>
        <li><b>English</b></li>
        <li><b>Dutch</b> (B1 level, I can have a normal conversation but my reading and listening skills are better. I love to practice, though!)</li>
        <li><b>French</b> (Very limited)</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Digital Media Technology</h5>

        <tr>
            <td "style" "width: 20%">Prior Knowledge</td> <td>My current level of technical skills is avery basic knowledge of Python from a course I followed last year called 'Hacking the Humanities' plus a little HTML from another course from the Digital humanities minor. Asides from that, mu knowledge is limited to what we've learned in this course so far.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Expectations</td> <td> I expect to learn the basics of a variety of coding languages and hope to gain a more in depht knowledge of one or two. Moreover, I expect to hear about the purposes for which the different languages are used and how we as students might apply them in our future careers. </td>

    <h3>Work</h3>
    <p>As mentioned, I did an extracurricular internship during my BA. Specifically, I was an editorial intern for the online magazine <a href="dutchreview.com"> DutchReview </a>. It was a wonderful experience and I was offered a part time job after my internship. Working as an editor and creative writer (mostly on sponsored content), I stayed with DutchReview for another six months.</p>
    <p>This summer, I then got the opportunity to help a friend open a yoga studio. I quit my job at DutchReview and now most of my free time goes to yoga.</p>
    <h4>Work/Passion</h4>
    <i>So, yoga.</i>
    <p>Last November, I finished my 200 hours Yoga Teacher Training and now work as a yoga teacher at <a href="balanzs.com"> Balanzs</a> in The Hague and at <a href="yogacorner.nl">Yoga Corner</a> in Wateringen (the studio my friend opened!)</p>
    <p>I teach Vinyasa, Warm Vinyasa Flow, Hot Yoga, and the occasional Power Yoga class.</p>
    <p>Both studios have a 7-day free trial, so let my know if you want to join a class!</p>
    <h3>Hobbies</h3>
    <p>Here are a few of my hobbies:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Reading — me and some friends also recently started a book club;</li>
        <li>knitting;</li>
        <li>yoga;</li>
        <li>and all the other usual stuff — scooping out cute cafés, hanging out with friends, baking and such.</li>
    </ul>
