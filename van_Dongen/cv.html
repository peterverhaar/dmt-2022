<h1>Laura van Dongen</h1>
   
    <p>In 2015 I started studying at Leiden University. A couple of years (<i>and mostly studies</i>) later I graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in <a href="https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/onderwijs/opleidingen/bachelor/film-en-literatuurwetenschap"> Film and Literature.</a><br>
        During the second year I chose to follow the film track since I did not wanted to write <b>TWO</b> theses. However, I still liked the thought of combining the two studies, so I decided to sign up for the minor <a href="https://studiegids.universiteitleiden.nl/studies/8266/boek-boekhandel-en-uitgeverij#tab-1"> Boek, Boekhandel en Uitgeverij</a>, which I really enjoyed!</p> 
    <p>When I was 20 years old I started to work at <a href="https://gameliner.nl/"> Gameliner</a>, a website which focuses on articles and reviews about games. So I already am quite familiar with the use of HTML but I am still interested in the course Digital Media Technology and the further knowledge it will bring me.</p>
<img src="me.jpg" width = "200"/> <p>Next to my studies I enjoy the following:
<ol> 
<li>Practicing music (<i>I play the double-bass and harp for instance</i>)</li>
<li>Going to the cinemas (<i>How could I not with my main specialisation</i>)</li>
<li>Reading (<i>Fantasy and graphic-novels are my favorites</i>)</li>
<li>"Uitwaaien" at the beach (<i>Even during the winter!</i>)</li>
</ol></p>
    <p><table>
        <tr><td>Prior knowledge</td><td>As discussed before I already have some knowledge surrounding the use of HTML. This includes some Python as well
        Besides my own experience I have quite a number of friends who work or study within the field of coding and who have shown me some tips and tricks!</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Expectations</td><td>I hope I learn more about working with digital text and its layout. In January I hope to start an internship with a publisher in Amsterdam and will try to apply what I learned during DMT classes.</td></tr>
