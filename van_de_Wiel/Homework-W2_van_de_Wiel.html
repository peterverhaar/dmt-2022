  <p> Hi! My name is Karlijn van de Wiel, I am 24 years old, and I am doing the masters <b>Book and Digital Media Studies</b>. I will tell you more on my <i>previous studies</i>, <i>hobbies</i>, my <i>interests</i>, and the <i>languages</i> I master, here below!</p>
  <h3>Previous studies</h3>
  <p>I studied English Language and Culture at <a href="https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/"> Leiden University</a> from 2019 until 2022. I also followed the course Illustration and Animation at <a href="https://stjoost.nl/"> St. Joost School of Art and Design</a> before that from 2015 to 2020.</p>

  <h3>Hobbies and interests</h3>
  <p>I have various hobbies and interests. I love to:
    <ul>
      <li>draw,</li>
      <li>bake,</li>
      <li>read,</li>
      <li>watch movies and series,</li>
      <li>listen to music,</li>
      <li>workout,</li>
      <li>go on bike rides, and</li>
      <li>travel.</li>
    </ul>
      I am also interested in:
      <ul>
        <li>art,</li>
        <li>music, and</li>
        <li><i>books</i> (of course).</li></p>
      </ul>
    <p> My interest in books started as a child, when I already loved to read and look at the illustrations in books. That is one of the reasons why I ended up following a course on illustration and animation in 2015. You can visit my work <a href="https://www.instagram.com/karlijnillustraties/"> here</a>. After finishing this course, I discovered I wanted to learn more about the book in general. I became interested in publishing and book history. I further developed this interest when I followed the minor <b>Boek, Boekhandel en Uitgeverij</b> at Leiden University during my BA in English. At the same time, I also started working at the University Library for two days a week and learned more about the relevance of metadata, archiving and open access publishing. This all encouraged me to enroll for this masters!</p>
   
  <h3>Languages</h3>
    <p> I only master two languages:
    <ul>
      <li>Dutch, and</li>
      <li>English.</li>
    </ul></p>
