    <p> <b> Who am I?</b> <br>Hi, I am a 23 year old student, who has just finished her BA degree from <a href= "https://www.uu.nl"> Utrecht University.</a> 
        <br> The BA I followed was a BA in English language and Culture. I currently live in a tiny studio in Amersfoort with my lovely cat Millie. <br> 
    I am a big book lover, which evidently inspired me to follow a career revolving around books. Aside from reading, I love having drinks with my friends.
    To finance my housing and hobbies, I work at a fancy shoestore in Amsterdam during the weekends. I am aware that I'm crazy for studying in Leiden,
    working in Amsterdam and living in Amersfoort, but I love it!</p>
    
    <p> <b> Languages I master</b> <br> 
    <ul>
        <li> Dutch </li>
        <li> English </li>
