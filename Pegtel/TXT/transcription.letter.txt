<salute>
Dear <persName>Wolff</persName>,
</salute>
</opener>
<p>
These are the worst of a bundle that arrived this morning. They
seem to me to transform the situation and I ask your advice on it
not merely because your reputation is also involved but because I
much want to know what you think.
First thoughts on the <orgName>Daily Express<orgName> cutting force me to the view
that is my duty to sue the paper. I can see only one good rea-
son for refraining, the loathing with which my wife would regard 
the proceeding. If I don't, on the other hand, my evidence, past
and future, everything I have written and anything I may ever
write is publicly discredited. I can think of no other wat of 
escape from the position of a man <unclear reason="ink smudged" cert="medium"></unclear> who is proved on official
evidence to be a liar. It would not be enough, for example to
make the &apos;Express&apos; give me a whole column in answer. People in fut-
ure would simply allude to me and, what matter far more, to what
I have written, as a person and a book of notorious falsity. That 
is quite clearly my first view an I cannot imagine anything to
make it different after a month&apos;s reflection.
Is there any friend in the great world to whom you could venture
to submit the point? I enclose the draft of what I proposed to 
write to the press, a procedure that now seems to me so inadequate.

<salute>			yours

PS.
On second thought I don&apos;t see why I should trouble 
you with the statement.
I could go to <placeName>London</placeName> on Friday. Is there any 
lawyer of special experience you think I might 
consult on that day?
The white paper does not say that
Anything I alleged was &quot;Cruel & malicious&quot;
Or &quot;The precise opposite of the truth&quot;
- See pile of the Cind. 2629.
