Dear Woolf,

Both your original estimates of Cast-Jean and Lour Slatements in recent months vary a great deal - I don't mean  unreasonably, but they do. Your estimates of a total profit of  £35 if the first ed. of 1050 sold out for a selling [unintelligible] of 12/6. (4.8.24). And on 16 July you say you would be amazed if the total cost to me exceeded £300, whereas in your statement of 19.10.25. there is "expenditure, 1st edition, £362.5.4."

The chief reason for these variations is I believe [unintelligible]. You don't normally count it as part of cost. Normally it may not be. Actually it is [unintelligible] salary, rent are part of real production costs.

Don't imagine I am finding fault. I am only explaining why I shoke as I did - and, by the way I see in [unintelligible] of 16.7.24 you anticipate a profit to me of £100 at least from the sale of 1000 copies at 12/6.

The [unintelligible] of [unintelligible] in your estimate of the [unintelligible] of a 4/6 edition to my mind invalidates them. What I want is to know how actually I should stand
A if 1000 copies sold
B if 2000 "         "
C if 3000 "         "
at 4/6.

Don't bother to work out the amounts now. Time enough in six months unless of course something happens in Kenya to boost sales.  But by my calculations I shall make no profit if 3000 sell at 4/6 and shall lose if fewer sell. So that I [unintelligible] to an edition of 4000!

What I should be tremendously grateful for is that you should [unintelligible] copies to your influential friends, e.g. Bernard Shaw, 'A Hable Hawk' of the New Slatesman. It's no use for me to do if nobody breaks into [unintelligible] our aleths from me. And speech with me should in quite other sensations. But the notourishing task is that so many people do break in to  various emotions when they read 'Kenya'.

Yours,
Norman Leys

P.S.
If recent statement from your office makes my profit on the first ed. £81 you now make it £71. I thought at the time £81 must be impossibly high. But don't trouble to go into these things now. I suggest an exact statement and a plan of campaign for the cheap edition complete in [unintelligible] detail - all these in the spring - my last gamble  in authorship!
