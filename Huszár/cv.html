    <h2>Lili Boglárka Huszár</h2>
    <h3><i>23 years old, hungarian, nature lover, yogi, hobby cook</i></h3>
    <p> Hi! I am Lili, starting Book and Digital Media Studies at <a href="https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en">Leiden University</a>. I moved to The Hague from Hungary 1 month ago, where I studied Commerce and Marketing as my Bachelor's.</p>
        <p> I choose to study in the Netherlands to meet new people and experience living abroad. I have some experience with digital text, as I worked at a webdeveloper company for 1,5 years.</p>
<p> In my free time I like reading (obviously), watching films, tv shows. I am an enthusiastic cook, and yoga is part of my everyday life. Sustainability and living a conscious lifestyle is really important to me.</p>
    <h4>Here are some of the books that had an effect on me growing as a person:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li> J.K. Rowling: Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Askaban </li>
        <li> Cassandra Clare : The City of Bones </li>
        <li> J.R.R. Tolkien : The Hobbit </li>
        <li> Summer Rayne Oaks : How to make a plant love you </li>
        <li> William Golding: Lord of the Flies </li>
    </ul>
