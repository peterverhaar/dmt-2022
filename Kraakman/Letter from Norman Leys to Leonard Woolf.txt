Dear <persName>Woolf</persName>

If you have time and can<lb></lb>be bothered perhaps you will before<lb></lb>the <date>29th</date> check the following estimates<lb></lb>of a [unintelligible] edition of <novel>Kenya</novel>.
3000 to [unintelligible] at 4/6 and to<lb></lb>cost [U+00A3] 270, so that if 2000<lb></lb>should sell the cost would be<lb></lb>just about covered.
Also if not too much trouble<lb></lb>would [unintelligible] out how?<lb></lb>Shall [unintelligible] when all copies<lb></lb>sold to date are paid for.
I don't dream of putting out<lb></lb>a cheap edition before [unintelligible]<lb></lb>[unintelligible] - much more likely this<lb></lb>time next year if you approve.
I am to [unintelligible] and<lb></lb>consult him about arranging with<lb></lb>the W.E.A - before [unintelligible].
Yours sincerely <persName>Norman Leys</persName>
