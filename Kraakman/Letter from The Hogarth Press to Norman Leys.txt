Dear <persName>Leys</persName>:

I think you were rather astonished by my statement that the origi-<lb></lb>nal estimate which I gave you for <novel>"Kenya"</novel> was accurate, and that<lb></lb>you remained a little doubtful. I looked up my original letter and<lb></lb>estimate last night and compared them with the expenditure on the first<lb></lb>edition. I enclose a short statement showing that I was correct.<lb></lb>When you reckon that the cost of the maps was [U+00A3]6.10.0. you will find<lb></lb>that my estimate of <date>August 1924</date> was within 19/7[U+00BD] of the actual expendi-<lb></lb>ture.

Yours,
